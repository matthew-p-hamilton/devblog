What are we going to build the next quarter?

1. Preparation
2. Review Company Vision, Mission, and Quarterly Goals
3. Define Customer, Business, and Technical Needs
4. Align Needs with Product Backlog

# Preparation

- Total time spent should be 4 hours maximum. Block off calendar time in 1 or 2 blocks for all attendees well in advance. Stick to the calendar times as your time box.
- The session can be run virtually or in person. Take notes in a shared document, using a tool like Google Docs or Notion.
- Should be led by the CEO or Head of Product. Someone who has a full view of the organization, can stick to the agenda, and can faciliate discussion amongst all attendees.
- Attendees should be leadership from Product, Engineering at minimum (& Sales if you're B2B). Marketing, Support, and Operations leadership if they can be productive and would like to participate (if you even have them at this stage of your company).
- Your product backlog should be accessible to all attendees. Groomed or ungroomed, so long as work items can be properly discussed and debated.
- Relevant data points regarding customer feedback in hand.

# Review Company Mission, Vision, and Quarterly Goals

_Length: 30 Mins_

**Mission and Vision**

Write down your company's mission and vision statements, and review as a team. We start here because we should always be able to map our product efforts, even at the most granular level, back to our Company Mission and Vision. You should have these drafted already, but if not, spend time drafting them as a team. Don't get bogged down in this exercise though. They don't have to be perfect, they just need to move the team along. Perfection can come later.

(Mission and Vision are used as tools to help ensure that the company is going in the direction everyone thinks it is, and helps establish how you will get there as a team. If you just have one and not the other, that's fine as they're often interchangable.)

Ask yourselves -- Do these still make sense and are we all still aligned that this is the direction we are going? If so, great. If not, which may often be the case with an early stage company, spend a few minutes and draft something new. Again, don't get bogged down, but get to high level agreement statements that align with the company's direction.

**Quarterly Goals**

How do we know we're moving the needle?

OKRs are a great framework here. At early-stage, you should really only have 1 company objective, and up to 3 company KPIs. You could possibly get away with 2 objectives, but you run the risk of spreading your resources too thin.

Some examples:

- Objective: Expand product distribution channels into paid advertising.
  - KPI: Achieve 100% growth in Daily Active Users, from 1000 to 2000, with 50% resulting from Google Paid Ads, by the end of Q1.
- Objective: Achieve revenue targets
  - KPI: Increase Annual Recurring Revenue by 30%, from $100 million to $130 million by the end of Q1.
- Objective: Expand our business in new markets.
  - KPI: Expand operations into LATAM with Argentina product launch and 2 local support staff by the end of Q1.

Goals should be specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and time-based (SMART).
